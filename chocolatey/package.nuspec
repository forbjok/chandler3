    <summary>A thread downloader for imageboards such as 4chan.</summary>
    <description>See a thread you consider worthy of archival?
Don't trust the 4chan archives to remain available?
Or perhaps it's not on 4chan, but on some tiny obscure imageboard nobody else has heard of or considered worth archiving?

Chandler to the rescue!

Chandler is a commandline-utility for quickly and easily downloading threads from imageboards, as well as a fire and forget solution for watching threads indefinitely and downloading new posts as they become available.
For sites where this is supported (currently 4chan and Tinyboard-compatible sites), posts from previous threads which are later deleted will be preserved when updating threads.
